Kept [2] files on [2] found files
MegaLinter flavor [ci_light] doesn't contain linters REPOSITORY_CHECKOV,REPOSITORY_DEVSKIM,REPOSITORY_DUSTILOCK,REPOSITORY_KICS,REPOSITORY_SYFT,SPELL_CSPELL,SPELL_LYCHEE.
As they're not available in this docker image, they will not be processed
To solve this problem, please either: 
- use default flavor oxsecurity/megalinter
- add ignored linters in DISABLE or DISABLE_LINTERS variables in your .mega-linter.yml config file located in your root directory
- ignore this message by setting config variable FLAVOR_SUGGESTIONS to false
